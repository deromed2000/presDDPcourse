# Mid-Atlantic Wage Data
This application is based on the Wage and other data for a group of 3000 workers in the Mid-Atlantic region in US.

The Goal of this application is first to explore this data with some graphes and secondly to do prediction interactively with user. The prediction is based on Random Forest model.

In plot tab we explore data depending on education grade and race. These plots are reactive and we can adjust the range of age we want to show and/or the category of job plus whether the health insurance exists or not.
